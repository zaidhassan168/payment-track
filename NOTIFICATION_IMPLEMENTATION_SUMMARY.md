# Notification System Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

I've successfully implemented a complete push notification system in your Next.js payment-track application that replicates the functionality from your prc-flow-server Express.js application.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`/types/notifications.ts`** - Type definitions for notifications
2. **`/lib/notification-service.ts`** - Core notification service with Expo SDK integration
3. **`/lib/user-service.ts`** - User management and recipient determination logic
4. **`/lib/notification-utils.ts`** - Utility functions for triggering notifications
5. **`/app/api/notifications/route.ts`** - Main notification API endpoint
6. **`/app/api/notifications/test/route.ts`** - Test endpoints for debugging
7. **`/docs/NOTIFICATIONS_API.md`** - Complete API documentation
8. **`/docs/MOBILE_APP_INTEGRATION.md`** - Mobile app integration guide

### Files Modified:
1. **`/app/api/procurement/[id]/route.ts`** - Added automatic notifications on status updates
2. **`/app/api/procurement/route.ts`** - Added automatic notifications for new requests
3. **`/app/dashboard/procurement/components/ProcurementRequestModal.tsx`** - Fixed manager note functionality
4. **`/app/dashboard/procurement/page.tsx`** - Updated to handle manager notes
5. **`.env`** - Added EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN configuration

### Packages Installed:
- `expo-server-sdk` - For sending push notifications

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Notification Triggers
- **New Requests**: Automatically notify managers and quantity surveyors when new procurement requests are created
- **Status Updates**: Automatically notify relevant users when request status changes
- **Smart Recipients**: Intelligently determines who should receive notifications based on status and user roles

### 2. Status-Based Notification Logic
- **Pending**: → Managers + Quantity Surveyors
- **Quantity Checked**: → Managers + Original Engineer
- **Approved/Rejected**: → Original Engineer
- **Ordered/Processing/Shipped**: → Original Engineer
- **Arrived**: → Original Engineer + Managers

### 3. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/notifications` - Send notifications (for mobile app calls)
- `GET /api/notifications` - Health check
- `GET /api/notifications/test` - Various test endpoints
- `POST /api/notifications/test` - Send test notifications

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience
- Notifications won't break main request flow if they fail
- Automatic filtering of invalid push tokens
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful degradation

## How It Works

### For Web App Users:
1. When you create or update procurement requests in the web dashboard, notifications are automatically sent to relevant mobile app users
2. The system is fully integrated - no additional steps needed

### For Mobile App Users:
1. Mobile app registers for push notifications and saves expo push token to Firestore
2. Users receive notifications based on their role and involvement in procurement requests
3. Notifications include deep links to specific requests

## Integration with Existing Code

The notification system is seamlessly integrated with your existing procurement workflow:

- ✅ **Fixed the manager note issue** you mentioned - notes are now properly saved and passed through the update process
- ✅ **Automatic notifications** - No code changes needed for basic functionality
- ✅ **Uses existing Firebase Admin SDK** - Leverages your current authentication and database setup
- ✅ **Respects user roles** - Only sends notifications to appropriate users based on their role

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Get Expo Access Token
1. Go to https://expo.dev/
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to Account Settings → Access Tokens
4. Create a new token
5. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
   ```

### 2. Update Mobile App
- Integrate push notification registration (see `/docs/MOBILE_APP_INTEGRATION.md`)
- Ensure user documents in Firestore include `expoPushToken` field

### 3. Test the System
Use the test endpoints to verify everything is working:
```bash
# Health check
GET http://localhost:3000/api/notifications

# Test user retrieval
GET http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/test?action=users&role=manager

# Send test notification
POST http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/test
{
  "createdByUid": "your-user-id"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Cost Effective**: No need for separate Express.js server - everything runs in Next.js
2. **Scalable**: Uses Expo's infrastructure for reliable push notification delivery
3. **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with your existing procurement workflow
4. **Maintainable**: Well-documented with comprehensive error handling
5. **Free**: No additional hosting costs for the notification service

The system is ready to use! Just add your Expo access token and start testing with your mobile app.
